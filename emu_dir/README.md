====================
EMULATOR DIRECTORY
====================

Two branches: emulator and controller. Emulator branch contains the source code for the HeliRig emulator and the controller branch contains source code for the controller.
Both branches target the same TI TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller on the TI Tiva Boards.
Only the controller program is implemented with FreeRTOS. The emulator is just a simpler round robin.

Only the source code for the emulator should be here!
