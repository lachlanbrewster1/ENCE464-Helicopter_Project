====================
CONTROLLER DIRECTORY
====================

Two branches: emulator and controller. Emulator branch contains the source code for the HeliRig emulator and the controller branch contains source code for the controller.
Both branches target the same TI TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller on the TI Tiva Boards.
Both the emulator and controller programs are implemented with FreeRTOS.

Only the source code for the controller should be here!
