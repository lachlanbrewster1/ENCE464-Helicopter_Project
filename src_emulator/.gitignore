# In the ideal happy and perfect world, CCS and git would 
# together work perfectly, allowing the user to seamlessly and 
# painlessly compile executables. But this is not the case.

# Instead all CCS generated files are ignored and only the source files 
# are controlled. Instead a local workspace is created on the user's
# local computer which is completely independent of version control,
# and the user *imports* in and links to the source code. The source
# code lies in another directory, which is version controlled.
